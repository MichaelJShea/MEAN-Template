A MVC structured template I made using Angular, Node.js, Express, mongoose and MongoDB for a good starting place to create a fullstack MEAN aplication.
You can use this as a starting point for your project and build Schema's as you see fit. 
All API routes cover basic CRUD applications. 


1. USE "npm init -y" to initialize project
2. USE "npm install --save" to install all dependancies in the package.json file.
3. Create your Schema in the models.js file, you can change this filename if you need to. 
4. Make sure if you change the schema name to change it in the server side routes.js file. 
5. To use MongoDB make sure you have it installed and have mongod running inthe background on the server side. 
6. use ng build --watch to build project and listen for changes on angular side. (or npm start)
7. Happy Coding!
